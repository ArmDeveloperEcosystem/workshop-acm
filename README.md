# Azure cloud migration

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to TO REPLACE WITH ACTUAL DESCRIPTION

## TODO LIST

- [ ] Rewrite section 1 prepare
    - Get all account tokens will need throughout exercise
    - Use instruqt variables to store tokens???
- [ ] Rewrite section 2 create
    - Build application on Instruqt VM (x86?), with intent of being able to make docker image. Application should work by end locally
- [ ] Write section 3 Build
    - Create a standalone docker image that has model, application auto launched and open endpoint that can hit.
- [ ] Rewrite section 4 Terraform
    - Modify kubernetes node type to be compatible with new docker image
- [ ] Rewrite section 5 Import
    - Tweak to import image we created in step 3
- [ ] Rewrite section 6 Deploy
    - Rewrite to combine kubernetes deployment, but not using Go app and instead using LLM application
    - Instructions for using front end against public endpoint backend
- [ ] Write section 7 Demo
    - Write quick demo of KubeArchInspect
- [ ] Update this Readme to match actual content
- [ ] Import this repos content into Instruqt
- [ ] Test content in Instruqt

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Azure CLI.
- Docker with Buildx enabled.
- Terraform.
- Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)

You will of course also need access to an Azure subscription.

## Challenges

### 1: Prepare required services

Make sure can log into and get tokens for:

- Hugging Face

### 2: Terraform Azure services

Deploy AKS, ACR, and VM to build image

### 3: Create AI application Docker image

Go into VM and log into Azure

Build docker image and push to ACR

### 4: Deploy kubernetes services

Deploy our service on our AKS

Test our endpoint through a load balancer

Highlight that end users just hit the one load balancer endpoint, and the application will run on arm or x86. Donâ€™t have to remove existing x86 nodes to add arm ones, and then migrate towards arm overtime instead of all at once.

### 5: Front End

Run front end powered by kubernetes backend

### 6: Demo of KubeArchInspect

How you can use in your own Kubernetes deployments to check for arm compatibility.

## Conclusion

You have successfully created and deployed TO REPLACE WITH ACTUAL DESCRIPTION
